# Python_git (formerly known as cow_dump)

github repository for all dumb projects we make (half of which never see the light of day)

## Navigation tips

Yea... You'll need these tips if you want to know what the hell we are doing in what folder (as organization is totally our top priority and our best quality)
*Oh did I forget to mention that this mono-repo only has 2 Readme.MDs? yea... good damn luck to you!*

### ./live_events/

Place where our **actually active** projects are. If they are super important, we move them out of live_events into their own directory on the base folder

### ./inactive/

XD, here you'll find all the projects that are bad and abandoned.(or somehow we finished) None of them saw the light of day.

### ./testing/

Shhhh. top secret tests are here. This is a place for us to test things before we use them in our projects. Mostly junk. 
Mostly algorithems or some percise feature for something. But if you find anything you want to use, go ahead and take it!
We love people who recycle code from the 'scrapyard'.

## Contribute

Don't just don't, you're torturing yourself! (unless the project **SPECIFICALLY HAS** a CONTRIBUTE.MD)
Our code is spageutti enough working on it with **TWO** people. 
I'd be honestly suprised if you can read any of our code. (we barely comment, so goodluck :) )
