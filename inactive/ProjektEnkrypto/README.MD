# ProjektEnkrypto

Task: write an encryption service that changes the order of letters to 'encrypt' the message (will be used later in project chatty) so that way we can snek messages without somneone seeing and understanding it. This is really basic encryption but it'll get the job done.

## How to use?

Idk actually, we had some security thing that involved passwords set according to the TIME of day... yea, goodluck. We are in this together.
