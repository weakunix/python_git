Trade

There are 3 resources in the game:
Silk
Materials
Food

You can trade for these resources
Resources are important because you need them to build, repair (see Build and Upgrade), and keep the city happy (see City Happiness)
There will be a random trade deal every time
If you don't like the deal, you don't have to accept and the deal will change next time
