City Happiness

It is important to keep your city happy
Your city consumes 75 silk, 50 materials, and 100 food per day
If you do not have enough resources to give to the city they will get unhappy
If their happiness reaches 0 they will revolt and you will lose the game
Make sure you keep enough resources to give to your city
Trading will help this (see Trade)
