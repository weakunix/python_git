Save and Load

You are able to save and load your progress in this game
Keep in mind this may be a little buggy as it uses a txt file and it may not save if you close the tab
It will be a good idea to save often as sometimes online gdb may lose connection to the server
Everytime you save you will get a save number
If you wish to load your progress type in the save number to recover your progress
