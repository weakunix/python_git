# ProjectChatty

This is a IP to IP and port console messenger! Designed as a last ditch effort to communicate between us two if our parents screen time our messages.

## Is this project abandoned or is it done?

Both, the chatting service has bugs when you exit the chat that I've never fixed for ages as atleast the messages still went through. (still won't fix it, abandoned forever... sorry!)

## How do you use it?
