v11: split files for sending and recieving (unified the process)

we need to work on:

Send attachments
Make typing animation
Make reactions and message ID
Make group chat 
Voice messages
Video messages
Make UI


jason: 
privacy mode (hide ip)
sending and recieving at the same time

ruoyu:
project 495:
make a python sxript that reads out of a file and assigns each line to a variable

using ruoyu's project 495 we will do:
make better retract messages (rn is just bad) (using clear console and message history)
blocking(ip from file)
contacts (same as blocking)
