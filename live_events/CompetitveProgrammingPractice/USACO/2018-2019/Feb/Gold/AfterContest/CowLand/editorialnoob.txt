Logic:
Define path(a, b) as the xor path from a to b
Let lca(a, b) be the lowest common ancestor of a and b
It can be seen that path(a, b) = path(a, root) ^ path(b, root) ^ e[lca(a, b)]. lca(a, b) can be computed in O(1) time with a precomputation time of O(NlogN) using a sparse table. We can use a binary indexed tree to compute path(node, root) in O(logN) time

Approach (CowLand.cpp):
Implementation of the above solution

Takeaways:
-Confusing how bit needs both the start and end to be included when doing euler tour
    -Think about why that is
    -Try to make some connections
