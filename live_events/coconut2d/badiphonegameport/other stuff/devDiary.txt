over the course of a few days I managed to get a lot of things setup. Infact, I learned cocos2d and there are sprites!!!!! I started the drawing and laying out of the classes as soon as I could. They all had to inharit from the cocos.sprite layer because they were all sprites. I wonder how the game will look like when it is done though. Anyways, this is just a breif log. I forgot to log it on May 1 so here it is, 2 days later

over the course of a few days I was able to get the sprite sheets and sprites setup. I drew the sprites and cut them out into frames for animation. I was really bummed out at the end of the day when I couldn't make them animate based on frames according to my mouse position. But that would soon change. I also discovered how to make a button that presses and sends me to another scene! Horray! The lack of logs in cocos2dPy is really killing me. It(engine) is so dead but it is good.
