# CONSOLE COWCULATOR VERSION INFO AND UPDATES

## VERSION 1.0
### First official working version of cowculator!
This cowculator uses the shunting yard algorithm to convert an expression into a reverse polish expression and then get the answer

#### Working functions:
* Basic operators
    * \+
    * \-
    * \*
    * /
    * ^ or **
    * //
    * ()
* gcd
* lcm
* max
* min

#### Functions
Functions command not working cause I am too lazy to code it.

#### Modes
Modes just shows your current mode and all modes.

#### Switch
Switch doesn't do anything cause I only coded arithmetic mode right now/

#### Exit
Exit works cause it's just an exit.

#### What's this? A hidden function?
And of course for those people who actually read the readme, I will include a hidden function!
Of course it's the hidden airplane game (duh it's in every single cowculator version (actually I'm wrong because the first few versions of this cowculator won't cause I haven't coded it yet whoops)).
 
Type
```
hidden_airplane_game.launch()
```
Caps or not caps it doesn't matter mate.
You want to feel like a badass hacker so that's why I used something_something.launch().

### Things coming in version 1.1:
#### New functions:
* âˆš (square root)
* ! (factorial)
* !! (double factorial)
* root(x, y) (basically y to the root x (i.e. if y was 8 and x was 3 then it would be cube root y))
* floor(x) (for those people who don't know // is floor)
* ceiling(x) (celing (aka floor(x) + 1 when x is not an integer))
This is 100% coming out in version 1.1 of the Console Cowculator

#### Ans:
I may add an ans thing which is the following

Say your previous equation you typed in was 2 + 2
The output is 4
Instead of typing 4 * 2, you could just do ans * 2

Also I want to do something where you can do ans2 * 2 which would give you the second to last answer
In the previous example your answers would be [4, 8] so ans would be 8 and ans2 would be 4

I can't guarentee this will be in the version 1.1 of the Console Cowculator

#### Airplane Game:
I will make a new file and start working on the airplane game
This time your progress actually saves!

I can't guarentee this will be in the version 1.1 of the Console Cowculator
