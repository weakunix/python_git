Functions:

+: syntax: x + y, adds x and y
-: syntax: x - y, subtracts x and y
*: syntax: x * y, multiplies x and y
/: syntax: x / y, divides x and y
^: syntax: x ^ y, x to the power of y
**: syntax: x ** y, x to the power of y
//: syntax: x // y, the floor of x / y
√: syntax: √x, square root of x
%: syntax: x % y, x mod (modulo) y (remainder of x / y)
!: syntax: x!, x factorial (x * (x - 1) * (x - 2) * ...)
!!: syntax: x!!, x double factorial (x * (x - 2) * (x - 4) * ...)
max: syntax: max(1-infinite arguments), the greatest number of all the arguments
min: syntax: min(1-infinite arguments), the least number of all the arguments
sum: syntax: sum(1-infinite arguments), the sum of all the arguments
prod: syntax: prod(1-infinite arguments, the product of all the arguments
product: syntax: product(1-infinite arguments, the product of all the arguments
gcd: syntax: gcd(1-infinite arguments), the greatest common denominator of all the arguments
gcf: syntax: gcf(1-infinite arguments), the greatest common denominator of all the arguments
lcm: syntax: lcm(1-infinite arguments), the least common multiple of all the arguments
mean: syntax: mean(1-infinite arguments), the arithmetic mean of all the arguments
median: syntax: median(1-infinite arguments), the median of all the arguments (the middle number (or mean of the middle two numbers) when all numbers are ordered)
mode: syntax: mode(1-infinite arguments), the mode of all the arguments (the number(s) that appear most in all the numbers)
root: syntax: root(x, y), x root y (y ^ (1 / x))
floor: syntax: floor(x), the greatest integer that is less than or equal to x
ceiling: syntax: floor(x), the least integer that is greater than or equal to x
abs: syntax: abs(x), the absolute value of x
log: syntax: log(x, y), logarithm with x as base and y as argument (use log(x) for natural log of x)
factorize: syntax: factorize(x), gives all factors of x
prime_factorize: syntax: prime_factorize(x), prime factors of x
pf: syntax: pf(x), prime factors of x

ans: syntax: ans(optional x, optional y)
x is defaulted to -1 and y is defaulted to 'all'
x:
if x is positive it goes from the top of your list of answers (i.e if x is 2 and your answer list is [1, 1325, 32, 123] it would give you 1325)
if x is negative it goes from the bottom of your list of answers (i.e. if x is -2 and your answer list is [1, 1325, 32, 123] it would give you 32)
y:
if answers is a list of numbers (i.e. the answer of pf(12) would be [2, 2, 3]) you can use positive to go from the left of your answer and negative to go from the right of your answer
this gives you a specific number rather than the entire list

NOTE:
you can put functions inside of functions
for example:
max(gcd(1234, 34), lcm(124, 24))
