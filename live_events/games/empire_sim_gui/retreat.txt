Retreat:

During an attack when you reach 75, 50, 25, 10, and 5
health left on your army you will have the option to retreat

Retreating doesn't mean the enemy's health is set back to 100

If you would like to heal up your army during battle
you can retreat and continue your attack later

Keep in mind that the opponent's army heals by 5 health every day at 0000
