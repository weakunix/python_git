Attack:

In order to win the game you need to get 15 territory

You get territory with successful attacks

In order for attacks to be successful
you need to upgrade your army (see Build and Upgrade)

A stronger army will have a higher chance of succeeding

Attacking can result in hurting your army
You will need to heal it after the attack (see Build and Upgrade)

Keep in mind that it is possible to attack an enemy
with a higher strength than you successfully

It is also possible for your attack to fail
against an enemy with a lower strength than you
