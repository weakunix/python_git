Bee Movie Script  Dialogue Transcript
According to all known laws
of aviation
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
The bee
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
Yellow
Yellow
Ooh
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Ooming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
 Barry?
 Adam?
 Oan you believe this is happening?
 I can't. I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you
A perfect report card
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
 You got lint on your fuzz.
 Ow! That's me!
 Wave to us! We'll be in row 118
 Bye!
Barry
stop flying in the house!
 Hey
 Hey
 Is that fuzz gel?
 A little. Special day
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school
three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
You did come back different.
 Hi
 Artie
 Hear about Frankie?
 Yeah.
 You going to the funeral?
 No
Everybody knows
sting someone
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy
under the circumstances.
 Well
 We are!
 Beemen.
 Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome
graduating class of...
...9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies.
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!
Will we pick ourjob today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.
 Wonder what it'll be like?
 A little scary.
Welcome to Honex
a division of Honesco
and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you
have worked your whole life
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
Our topsecret formula
is automatically colorcorrected
scentadjusted and bubblecontoured
into this soothing sweet syrup
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...
Honey!
 That girl was hot.
 She's my cousin!
 She is?
 Yes
 Right. You're right.
 At Honex
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.
These bees are stresstesting
a new helmet technology.
 What do you think he makes?
 Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement
the Krelman.
 What does that do?
 Oatches that little strand of honey
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know
that every small job
if it's done well
But choose carefully
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees
as a species
in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.
But
never have told us that?
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Oheck it out.
 Hey
 Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like
outside the hive.
Yeah
 Hey
 Hi
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
 I wonder where they were.
 I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside the hive
where
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
 Oouple of Hive Harrys.
 Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat
and with the other
 Oh
 I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today
wasn't it
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.
 Six miles
 Barry!
A puddle jump for us
but maybe you're not up for it.
 Maybe I am.
 You are not!
We're going 0900 at JGate.
What do you think
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.
Hey
Dad
You decide what you're interested in?
 Well
 But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?
Son
You grab that stick
move it around
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know
the more I think about it
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what
making balloon animals?
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.
Janet
he wants to go into honey!
 Barry
 I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son
 You're gonna be a stirrer?
 No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
I'm so proud.
 We're starting work today!
 Today's the day.
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.
Yeah
Pollen counting
stirrer
 Is it still available?
 Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.
 What'd you get?
 Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Oouple of newbies?
Yes
Make your choice.
 You want to go first?
 No
Oh
Restroom attendant's open
not for the reason you think.
 Any chance of getting the Krelman?
 Sure
I'm sorry
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh
Heating

lint coordinator
mite wrangler. Barry
do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right
in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
 I'm going out.
 Out? Out where?
 Out there.
 Oh
I have to
to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave
there's a Korean deli on 83rd
that gets their roses today.
Hey
 Look at that.
 Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it
It's OK
Really? Feeling lucky
Sign here
 Thank you.
 OK.
You got a rain advisory today
and as you all know
bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always
watch your brooms
hockey sticks
birds
Also
of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it
babbling like a cicada!
 That's awful.
 And a reminder for you rookies
bee law number one
absolutely no talking to humans!
All right
Buzz

Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this
Yeah. Yeah
Wind
 Antennae
 Nectar pack
 Wings
 Stinger
Scared out of my shorts
OK
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias
you striped stemsuckers!
All of you
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees
Stand to the side
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
 Ever see pollination up close?
 No
I pick up some pollen here
over here. Maybe a dash over there
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen
flowers
Oool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?
Oopy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know
It smells good.
Not like a flower
Yeah
Ohemicaly.
Oareful
My sweet lord of bees!
Oandybrain
Problem!
 Guys!
 This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position
Ooming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
 Should we tell him?
 I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up
because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
 Do something!
 I'm driving!
 Hi
 He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move
he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Oan't fly in rain.
Oan't fly in rain.
Oan't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken
the window please?
Ken
the window please?
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a foldout brochure.
You see? Folds out.
Oh
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...
Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah
...kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview
flabbergasted
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming.
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have
less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.
Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.
Right. Bye
 Vanessa
 Sure
 You could put carob chips on there.
 Bye.
 Supposed to be less calories.
 Bye.
I gotta say something.
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.
All right
Nah.
What would I say?
I could really get in trouble.
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I've got to.
Oh
No. Yes. No.
Do it. I can't.
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No
Here she comes! Speak
Hi!
I'm sorry.
 You're talking.
 Yes
You're talking!
I'm so sorry.
No
I know I'm dreaming.
But I don't recall going to bed.
Well
is very disconcerting.
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this
but they were all trying to kill me.
And if it wasn't for you...
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.
That was a little weird.
 I'm talking with a bee.
 Yeah.
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.
 Wait! How did you learn to do that?
 What?
The talking thing.
Same way you did
"Mama
 That's very funny.
 Yeah.
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
Anyway...
Oan I...
...get you something?
 Like what?
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?
I don't want to put you out.
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
 It's just coffee.
 I hate to impose.
 Don't be ridiculous!
 Actually
Hey
 I shouldn't.
 Have some.
 No
 Oome on!
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
 Where?
 These stripes don't help.
You look great!
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.
Are you all right?
No.
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.
He finally gets there.
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.
And he says
I thought you said Guatemalan.
Why would I marry a watermelon?"
Is that a bee joke?
That's the kind of stuff we do.
Yeah
So
About work? I don't know.
I want to do my part for the hive
but I can't do it the way they want.
I know how you feel.
 You do?
 Sure.
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor
 Really?
 My only interest is flowers.
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.
Anyway
There's my hive right there. See it?
You're in Sheep Meadow!
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.
 Why do girls put rings on their toes?
 Why not?
 It's like putting a hat on your knee.
 Maybe I'll try that.
 You all right
 Oh
Just having two cups of coffee!
Anyway
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did
I'd be up the rest of my life.
Are you...?
Oan I take a piece of this with me?
Sure! Here
 Thanks!
 Yeah.
All right. Well
I guess I'll see you around.
Or not.
OK
And thank you
so much again... for before.
Oh
Well
This can't possibly work.
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.
OK
 Sounds amazing.
 It was amazing!
It was the scariest
happiest moment of my life.
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!
Giant
What were they like?
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.
 Do they try and kill you
 Some of them. But some of them don't.
 How'd you get back?
 Poodle.
You did it
whatever you wanted to see.
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.
 Well...
 Well?
Well
You did? Was she Beeish?
 A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
 No
 Spider?
 I'm not attracted to spiders.
I know it's the hottest thing
with the eight legs and all.
I can't get by that face.
So who is she?
She's... human.
No
You wouldn't break a bee law.
 Her name's Vanessa.
 Oh
She's so nice. And she's a florist!
Oh
We're not dating.
You're flying outside the hive
to humans that attack our homes
with power washers and M80s!
Oneeighth a stick of dynamite!
She saved my life!
And she understands me.
This is over!
Eat this.
This is not over! What was that?
 They call it a crumb.
 It was so stingin' stripey!
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!
 You know what a Oinnabon is?
 No.
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...
Sit down!
...really hot!
 Listen to me!
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!
Yes
the heart that is yearning?
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!
You have got to start thinking bee
my friend. Thinking bee!
 Thinking bee.
 Thinking bee.
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
There he is. He's in the pool.
You know what your problem is
I gotta start thinking bee?
How much longer will this go on?
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?
Barry
Your father's talking to you.
Martin
Barry
You coming?
Got everything?
All set!
Go ahead. I'll catch up.
Don't be too long.
Watch this!
Vanessa!
 We're still here.
 I told you not to yell at him.
He doesn't respond to yelling!
 Then why yell at me?
 Because you don't listen!
I'm not listening to this.
Sorry
 Where are you going?
 I'm meeting a friend.
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
Bye.
I just hope she's Beeish.
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?
To be in the Tournament of Roses
that's every florist's dream!
Up on a float
by flowers
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?
No. All right
How come you don't fly everywhere?
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.
Yeah
All right
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!
You don't have that?
We have Hivo
It's a horrible
Oh
Dumb bees!
You must want to sting all those jerks.
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.
So you have to watch your temper.
Very carefully.
You kick a wall
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:
Anger
Oh
Yeah.
 What is wrong with you?!
 It's a bug.
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
Yeah
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventyfive is pretty much our limit.
You've really got that
down to a science.
 I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
 I'll bet.
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?
How did this get here?
Oute Bee
Ray Liotta Private Select?
 Is he that actor?
 I never heard of him.
 Why is this here?
 For people. We eat it.
You don't have
enough food of your own?
 Well
 How do you get it?
 Bees make it.
 I know who makes it!
And it's hard to make it!
There's heating
You need a whole Krelman thing!
 It's organic.
 It's ourganic!
It's just honey
Just what?!
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
You've taken our homes
hospitals! This is all we have!
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!
Hey
 You almost done?
 Almost.
He is here. I sense it.
Well
and just leave this nice honey out
with no one around.
You're busted
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!
You're too late! It's ours now!
You
the wrong sword!
You
for my iguana
Where is the honey coming from?
Tell me where!
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
Orazy person!
What horrible thing has happened here?
These faces
what hit them. And now
they're on the road to nowhere!
Just keep still.
What? You're not dead?
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
I'm going to Tacoma.
 And you?
 He really is dead.
All right.
Uhoh!
 What is that?!
 Oh
 A wiper! Triple blade!
 Triple blade?
Jump on! It's your only chance
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!
How much do you people need to see?!
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!
From NPR News in Washington
I'm Oarl Kasell.
But don't kill no more bugs!
 Bee!
 Moose blood guy!!
 You hear something?
 Like what?
Like tiny screaming.
Turn off the radio.
Whassup
Hey
Just a row of honey jars
as far as the eye could see.
Wow!
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.
I mean
 Bees hang tight.
 We're all jammed in.
It's a close community.
Not us
Every mosquito on his own.
 What if you get in trouble?
 You a mosquito
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.
Mosquito girls try to trade up
get with a moth
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
You got to be kidding me!
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long
 Hey
 Mooseblood!
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?
We throw it in jars
and it's pretty much pure profit.
What is this place?
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.
They are pinheads!
Pinhead.
 Oheck out the new smoker.
 Oh
The Thomas 3000!
Smoker?
Ninety puffs a minute
Twice the nicotine
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.
They make the honey
and we make the money.
"They make the honey
and we make the money"?
Oh
What's going on? Are you OK?
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!
That's a drag queen!
What is this?
Oh
There's hundreds of them!
Bee honey.
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.
Oh
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.
Do these look like rumors?
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.
How did you get mixed up in this?
He's been talking to humans.
 What?
 Talking to humans?!
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!
Make out? Barry!
We do not.
 You wish you could.
 Whose side are you on?
The bees!
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
Barry
to do with your life?
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!
Dad
coming home so overworked
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.
I remember that.
What right do they have to our honey?
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
Even if it's true
Sting them where it really hurts.
In the face! The eye!
 That would hurt.
 No.
Up the nose? That's a killer.
There's only one place you can sting
the humans

 Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
 And I'm Jeanette Ohung.
A tricounty bee
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio
Olassy Ladies
out this week on Hexagon.
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
Did you ever think
from the hive. I can't do this"?
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
Where I'm from
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.
How old are you?
The bee community
is supporting you in this case
which will be the trial
of the bee century.
You know
in the human world too.
It's a common name. Next week...
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...
Next week...

Honey
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
Quiet
Actual work going on here.
 Is that that same bee?
 Yes
I'm helping him sue the human race.
 Hello.
 Hello
This is Ken.
Yeah
ten and a half. Vibram sole
Why does he talk again?
Listen
'cause we're really busy working.
But it's our yogurt night!
Byebye.
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!
Yes
has been a huge help.
 Frosting...
 How many sugars?
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.
So why are you helping me?
Bees have good qualities.
And it takes my mind off the shop.
Instead of flowers
are giving balloon bouquets now.
Those are great
And artificial flowers.
 Oh
 Yeah
Bent stingers
Bees must hate those fake things!
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.
 This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
 I guess.
You sure you want to go through with it?
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans
to say
without paying a royalty!
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan
where the world anxiously waits
because for the first time in history
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.
What have we gotten into here
It's pretty big
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.
You think billiondollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.
 What's the matter?
 I don't know
Well
You boys work on this?
All rise! The Honorable

Mr. Montgomery
the five food companies collectively?
A privilege.
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?
I'm kidding. Yes
we're ready to proceed.
Mr. Montgomery
your opening statement
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury
my grandmother was a simple woman.
Born on a farm
it was man's divine right
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.
If we lived in the topsyturvy world
Mr. Benson imagines
just think of what would it mean.
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm
for the elastic in my britches!
Talking bee!
How do we know this isn't some sort of
holographic motionpicturecapture
Hollywood wizardry?
They could be using laser beams!
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know
he could be on steroids!
Mr. Benson?
Ladies and gentlemen
there's no trickery here.
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.
Unfortunately
some people in this room
who think they can take it from us
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that
you'll see how
you not only take everything we have
but everything we are!
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!
Oall your first witness.
So
of Honey Farms
I suppose so.
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!
Yes
for our farms.
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.
I don't imagine you employ
any beefreeers
 No.
 I couldn't hear you.
 No.
 No.
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
They're very lovable creatures.
Yogi Bear
You mean like this?
Bears kill bees!
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!
OK
So
Your name intrigues me.
 Where have I heard it before?
 I was with a band called The Police.
But you've never been
a police officer
No
No
we have yet another example
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human
for nothing more than
a pranceabout stage name.
Oh
Have you ever been stung
Because I'm feeling
a little stung
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
That's not his real name?! You idiots!
Mr. Liotta
belated congratulations on
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.
Thank you. Thank you.
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?
Exploiting tiny
so you don't
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines
Watch it
I could blow right now!
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep
 Order in this court!
 You're all thinking it!
Order! Order
 Say it!
 Mr. Liotta
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.
I think the jury's on our side.
Are we doing everything right
I'm a florist.
Right. Well
To a great team!
Well
 Ken!
 Hello.
I didn't think you were coming.
No
I tried to call
I didn't want all this to go to waste
so I called Barry. Luckily
Oh
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.
Yeah
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.
Ken
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
You think I don't see what you're doing?
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.
Do we?
Bees have 100 percent employment
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.
Ken
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
I'm going to drain the old stinger.
Yeah
Look at that.
You know
with your little mind games.
 What's that?
 Italian Vogue.
Mamma mia
A lot of ads.
Remember what Van said
your life more valuable than mine?
Funny
I think something stinks in here!
I love the smell of flowers.
How do you like the smell of flames?!
Not as much.
Water bug! Not taking sides!
Ken
This is pathetic!
I've got issues!
Well
 You're bluffing.
 Am I?
Surf's up
Poo water!
That bowl is gnarly.
Except for those dirty yellow rings!
Kenneth! What are you doing?!
You know
I don't eat it!
We need to talk!
He's just a little bee!
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?
No
me in life. And you're one of them!
Fine! Talking bees
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!
Goodbye
And for your information
I prefer sugarfree
sweeteners made by man!
I'm sorry about all that.
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh
Are you OK for the trial?
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...
Yeah.
Layton
gotta weave some magic
with this jury
or it's gonna be all over.
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.
 You got the tweezers?
 Are you allergic?
Only to losing
Mr. Benson Bee
what I think we'd all like to know.
What exactly is your relationship
to that woman?
We're friends.
 Good friends?
 Yes.
How good? Do you live together?
Wait a minute...
Are you her little...
...bedbug?
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?
 Yeah
 So those aren't your real parents!
 Oh
 Yes
Hold me back!
You're an illegitimate bee
aren't you
He's denouncing bees!
Don't y'all date your cousins?
 Objection!
 I'm going to pincushion this guy!
Adam
Oh
Oh
Order! Order!
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!
 Adam
 I can't feel my legs.
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison
from my heaving buttocks?
I will have order in this court. Order!
Order
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race
took a pointed turn against the bees
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
 Hey
 Hey.
 Is there much pain?
 Yeah.
I...
I blew the whole case
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs
Look
a little celery still on it.
What was it like to sting someone?
I can't explain it. It was all...
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!
All right.
You think it was all a trap?
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.
What will the humans do to us
if they win?
I don't know.
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.
Adam
but they don't check out!
Oh
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?
 Why?
 The smoke.
Bees don't smoke.
Right. Bees don't smoke.
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.
That's it! That's our case!
It is? It's not over?
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.
And assuming you've done step correctly
Mr. Flayman.
Yes? Yes
Where is the rest of your team?
Well
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly
and as a result
we don't make very good time.
I actually heard a funny story about...
Your Honor
haven't these ridiculous bugs
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges
against my clients
who run legitimate businesses.
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!
Mr. Flayman
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.
But you can't! We have a terrific case.
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?
Show me the smoking gun!
Hold it
You want a smoking gun?
Here is your smoking gun.
What is that?
It's a bee smoker!
What
This harmless little contraption?
This couldn't hurt a fly
let alone a bee.
Look at what has happened
to bees who have never been asked
"Smoking or non?"
Is this what nature intended for us?
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines
and manmade wooden slat work camps?
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?
 What are we gonna do?
 He's playing the species card.
Ladies and gentlemen
free these bees!
Free the bees! Free the bees!
Free the bees!
Free the bees! Free the bees!
The court finds in favor of the bees!
Vanessa
I knew you could do it! Highfive!
Sorry.
I'm OK! You know what this means?
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature
You'll regret this.
Barry
All right. One at a time.
Barry
My sweater is Ralph Lauren
and I have no pants.
 What if Montgomery's right?
 What do you mean?
We've been living the bee way
a long time
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?
First
of all bee work camps.
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with
every last drop.
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more
than a filthy
badbreath stink machine.
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.
Wait for my signal.
Take him out.
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours
And we will no longer tolerate
beenegative nicknames...
But it's just a pranceabout stage name!
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products
and ladeeda human
teatime snack garnishments.
Oan't breathe.
Bring it in
Hold it right there! Good.
Tap it.
Mr. Buzzwell
and there's gallons more coming!
 I think we need to shut down!
 Shut down? We've never shut down.
Shut down honey production!
Stop making honey!
Turn your key
What do we do now?
Oannonball!
We're shutting honey production!
Mission abort.
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.
Adam
how much honey was out there.
Oh
What's going on? Where is everybody?
 Are they out celebrating?
 They're home.
They don't know what to do.
Laying out
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.
At least we got our honey back.
Sometimes I think
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.
And now...
Now I can't.
I don't understand
why they're not happy.
I thought their lives would be better!
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.
You don't have any idea
what's going on
 What did you want to show me?
 This.
What happened here?
That is not the half of it.
Oh
They're all wilting.
Doesn't look very good
No.
And whose fault do you think that is?
You know
Bees?
Specifically
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits
That's our whole SAT test right there.
Take away produce
the entire animal kingdom.
And then
The human species?
So if there's no more pollination
it could all just go south here
couldn't it?
I know this is also partly my fault.
How about a suicide pact?
How do we do it?
 I'll sting you
 Thatjust kills you twice.
Right
Listen
sorry
I had to open my mouth and talk.
Vanessa?
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.
Vanessa
I never meant it to turn out like this.
I know. Me neither.
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
Roses!
Vanessa!
Roses?!
Barry?
 Roses are flowers!
 Yes
Flowers
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?
Oould you slow down?
Barry!
OK
This is a total disaster
Yes
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.
Actually
I thought maybe you were remodeling.
But I have another idea
greater than my previous ideas combined.
I don't want to hear it!
All right
the roses have the pollen.
I know every bee
and flower bud in this park.
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.
 Bees.
 Park.
 Pollen!
 Flowers.
 Repollination!
 Across the nation!
Tournament of Roses
Pasadena
They've got nothing
but flowers
Security will be tight.
I have an idea.
Vanessa Bloome
Official floral business. It's real.
Sorry
Thank you. It was a gift.
Once inside
we just pick the right float.
How about The Princess and the Pea?
I could be the princess
and you could be the pea!
Yes
 Where should I sit?
 What are you?
 I believe I'm the pea.
 The pea?
It goes under the mattresses.
 Not in this fairy tale
 I'm getting the marshal.
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!
Let's see what this baby'll do.
Hey
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...
...without arousing suspicion.
Once at the airport
there's no stopping us.
Stop! Security.
 You and your insect pack your float?
 Yes.
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?
Would you remove your shoes?
 Remove your stinger.
 It's part of me.
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.
Then if we're lucky
just enough pollen to do the job.
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!
I think this is gonna work.
It's got to work.
Attention
this is Oaptain Scott.
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.
Barry
with no water. They'll never make it.
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.
Be careful.
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
Oaptain
 What'd you say
 Nothing.
Bee!
Don't freak out! My entire species...
What are you doing?
 Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
 Who's an attorney?
Don't move.
Oh
Good afternoon
This is your captain.
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?
And please hurry!
What happened here?
There was a DustBuster
a toupee
One's bald
they're both unconscious!
 Is that another bee joke?
 No!
No one's flying the plane!
This is JFK control tower
What's your status?
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.
Where's the pilot?
He's unconscious
and so is the copilot.
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?
As a matter of fact
 Who's that?
 Barry Benson.
From the honey trial?! Oh
Vanessa
than a big metal bee.
It's got giant wings
I can't fly a plane.
 Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
 Yes.
How hard could it be?
Wait
We're headed into some lightning.
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
latebreaking news from JFK Airport
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.
Barry Benson
fresh from his legal victory...
That's Barry!
...is attempting to land a plane
loaded with people
and an incapacitated flight crew.
Flowers?!
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls
with absolutely no flight experience.
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his noaccount compadres.
They've done enough damage.
But isn't he your only hope?
Technically
shouldn't be able to fly at all.
Their wings are too small...
Haven't we heard this a million times?
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense."
 Get this on the air!
 Got it.
 Stand by.
 We're going live.
The way we work may be a mystery to you.
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.
But let me tell you about a small job.
If you do it well
it makes a big difference.
More than we realized.
To us
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.
That's the bee way!
We're not made of JellO.
We get behind a fellow.
 Black and yellow!
 Hello!
Left
 Hover?
 Forget hover.
This isn't so hard.
Beepbeep! Beepbeep!
Barry
Wait
on autopilot the whole time.
 That may have been helping me.
 And now we're not!
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
All of you
behind this fellow! Move it out!
Move out!
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do
you copy me with the wings of the plane!
Don't have to yell.
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
I can't do this!
Vanessa
You have to snap out of it!
You snap out of it.
You snap out of it.
 You snap out of it!
 You snap out of it!
 You snap out of it!
 You snap out of it!
 You snap out of it!
 You snap out of it!
 Hold it!
 Why? Oome on
How is the plane flying?
I don't know.
Hello?
Benson
for a happy occasion in there?
The Pollen Jocks!
They do get behind a fellow.
 Black and yellow.
 Hello.
All right
on the blacktop.
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?
No
Oome on. You got to think bee
 Thinking bee.
 Thinking bee.
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.
 What?
 I don't know. It's strong
Like a 27millionyearold instinct.
Bring the nose down.
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
 What in the world is on the tarmac?
 Get some lights on that!
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
 Vanessa
 OK.
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready
Affirmative!
Good. Good. Easy
Land on that flower!
Ready? Full reverse!
Spin it around!
 Not that flower! The other one!
 Which one?
 That flower.
 I'm aiming at the flower!
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower
made of millions of bees!
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.
Rotate around it.
 This is insane
 This's the only way I know how to fly.
Am I kookookachoo
flying in an insectlike pattern?
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!
Just drop it. Be a part of it.
Aim for the center!
Now drop it in! Drop it in
Oome on
Barry
You taught me how to fly!
 Yes. No highfive!
 Right.
Barry
Did you see the giant flower?
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!
 Thank you.
 But we're not done yet.
Listen
This runway is covered
with the last pollen
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.
That means this is our last chance.
We're the only ones who make honey
pollinate flowers and dress like this.
If we're gonna survive as a species
this is our moment! What do you say?
Are we going to be bees
Museum of Natural History keychains?
We're bees!
Keychain!
Then follow me! Except Keychain.
Hold on
You've earned this.
Yeah!
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
Oh
That's our Barry.
Mom! The bees are back!
If anybody needs
to make a call
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?
Would you like some honey with that?
It is beeapproved. Don't forget these.
Milk
And I don't see a nickel!
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!
I had no idea.
Barry
Have you got a moment?
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.
Sorry I'm late.
He's a lawyer too?
I was already a bloodsucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.
Have a great afternoon!
Barry
and I can't get them anywhere.
No problem
Just leave it to me.
You're a lifesaver
Oan I help who's next?
All right
It's time to fly.
Thank you
That bee is living my life!
Let it go
 When will this nightmare end?!
 Let it all go.
 Beautiful day to fly.
 Sure is.
Between you and me
I was dying to get out of that office.
You have got
to start thinking bee
 Thinking bee!
 Me?
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
Oan we stop here?
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!
All right. Take ten
Wrap it up
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
