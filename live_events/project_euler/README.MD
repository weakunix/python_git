## What the hell is this?

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. (definition by Google)

### What are you guys doing?

We are trying to solve all the Euler problems by difficulty and skipping around aswell.

### Why are there two folders?

Because there are two active contributers on this repo. DUH

### What are the problems?

[Look here](https://projecteuler.net/archives), the problems range from 5% difficulty to 100%. Goodluck!
